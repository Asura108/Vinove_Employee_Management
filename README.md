# Vinove Employee Management made by Deepanshu Molasi

A new Flutter project.

## The project's Google maps MAY NOT WORK correctly IF the API key being used is expired. When using the application in a local environment , please make sure that a valid google cloud api key is inside the AndroidManifest.xml file located in the android/app/src/main/ directory, if you run this project and the google maps fails to load.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
